Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 3 -  Analyze-AB-Test-Results

# What is A/B Testing ?
A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions against each other to determine which one performs better.

# About the project

In this project, we will try to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
